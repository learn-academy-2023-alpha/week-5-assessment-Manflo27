# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: A super is the main class that is used in objects. A super is used for setting up subclassses that is the child to the super. A child class such as subclasses can call upon a super that will have the same relationship. The superclass passes data down to the subclasses so the information that is stored will be accessed by the subclasses. 

Researched answer: Inheritance allows classes to have relationships with each other, classes that share behaviors allow the code to be more structured. 
In Ruby, by calling "super" from a child class, the child class will invoke the same method as its parent class. A child classs is called a subclass, it allows behavior to inherited from the superclass. 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer:A gem is a project manager for Ruby, the gem is used to download dependencies in a ruby project. By using "gem",it allows the user to utilize a packaged manager that lays out certain features. Gem is similar to Yarn, having certain dependencies for the application that can be accessed by the user for certain task.

Researched answer: A gem is a library that is managed by the package manager RubyGems. Gems can be used to extend or modify functionality in Ruby applications. Commonly they're used to distribute reusable functionality that is shared with other users for use in their applications and libraries. Some gems provide command line utilities to help change the tasks and provide effiency.

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer:Relational database is a database that is organized just like an excel spreadsheet. It is organized by tables that have rows and columns.An example is creating a table or column of sports teams, identifying the color and name which would be strings. That database would hold as much data on the different teams in the schema.

Researched answer: A relational database is a type of database, it revolutionized the way users take in data. It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables. A database can have numerous tables that share a relationship with one another,the discription of the tables in a database with the different data types is referred to a  schema. A database can have numerous tables that share a relationship with one another.

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: In Ruby, primary keys are unique identifiers that are used to uniquely identify records in a database table. Primary keys are identifiers per column, they are important because it makes it easy to target a specific data in the database.

Researched answer: In the relational model of databases, a primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of columns that define a row and table. A primary key is named "id", that ID is going to be unique to the other keys to prevent confusion because of the instance variables. Basically, a primary key is simply a single characteristic, a unique id.

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: I can't recall what the HTTP verbs are, will have to to do more research. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Create allows for the user to add data. Read is calling upon a certain data, Update is changing or modifying the data, Read is displaying the data that already exist and delete removes the data from the database.

Researched answer: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Create refers to the operation of adding new data to the system, such as adding a new user or creating a new record.Read refers to the operation of retrieving data from the system, such as reading a user's profile or retrieving a list of records.Update refers to the operation of modifying existing data in the system, such as updating a user's email address or changing a record's status.
Delete refers to the operation of removing data from the system, such as deleting a user account or removing a record from a database.

HTTP verbs are standardized commands used by web clients and servers to communicate. Listed below are the HTTP verbs.
Get request - display the content
Post request - create new content
Put request- replace content 
Patch request - edit 
Delete request - remove content 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: Restful routes are bringing the methods that are applied to an object into HTTP requests. The standard RESTful routes include GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update), and DELETE (delete) for a resource. By using these, it will create a standard language of all the objects.

2. Model validations: Model validations are rules that apply to the attributes of a model object in order to ensure that the data being saved to a database meets certain criteria.

3. Params: Params is short for the word parameters, which is the values that are passed to a function or method in either Javascript or Ruby. Users use params to make their code more flexible and dynamic by allowing different values to be passed in at different times, without needing to change the code itself.

4. ERB: ERB stands for Embedded Ruby, which is a templating language used in web development to generate HTML and drop the Ruby code into the file. When adding text, it will show on the local host.

5. API: An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that enables different software applications to communicate with each other. Its a software that allows two applications to communicate with each other.
